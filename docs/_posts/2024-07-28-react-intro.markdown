<h1>Creating your first React app\</h1>
Create your react app with the command below. This will create the files and directories you need for your new react app. 

```
npx create-react-app react-app-name
```

Next you will navigate to the `react-app-name` directory and run the `npx start` command.

<img width="75%" src="/homepage/assets/images/npx-create-react-app.png" />
</p>

This will open up a browser window to `localhost:3000`.

</p>

Lets now use VSCode to create our first React app.  Lets edit the App.js file that was created by the `npx create-react-app react-app-name` command.  Open VSCode and navigate to the `react-app-name\src\` directory and open the App.js file.
